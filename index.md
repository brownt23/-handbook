## The Parallel Markets Employee Handbook
### Everything you need to know about making a career at Parallel Markets

This Handbook first came into existence in April of 2020, as the company unanimously agreed to move to a [Remote First](../work/index.md) paradigm.  With the uncertainty of COVID-19 we wanted to enshrine a set of values and work practices that could help make us stronger for the long term.

This is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about Parallel Markets the company, our culture, our process, and our history.  This Handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last.  This Handbook is not only public, it's set up so that [anyone can submit an update](https://github.com/parallel-markets/handbook).  The goal is to have a real-world description of how we get work done, not just ideal-case prescriptions that don't mirror reality.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, dear reader.  Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.  [The source for this handbook is on GitHub](https://github.com/parallel-markets/handbook). If you want to suggest a change or view the complete changelog, head on over.

## How to Read This Handbook
Since this Handbook is public, it should be obvious that simply reading this is not an employment contract.  Also, since this Handbook is constantly being updated, you should know that the current version represents our policies as they now stand (and any new versions of this Handbook replace all older versions).  This means that policies can change at any time, but we'll be sure to let you know if there are any important updates you need to be aware of (and you can always [see the history of changes](https://github.com/parallel-markets/handbook/commits/master) at any time).

For specific information about employee benefits, you should refer specifically to plan documentation, which is controlling. The policies and procedures in this Handbook are guidelines only.  Not all benefits included in this Handbook are provided to part-time and temporary employees. Except for the policy of at-will employment, which can only be changed in writing, Parallel has the maximum discretion permitted by law to change, modify or delete any provision in this Handbook at any time, with or without notice.
