# Why Remote
In April of 2020 the company unanimously agreed to move to a Remote First paradigm.  With the uncertainty of COVID-19 we wanted to enshrine a set of values and work practices that could help make us stronger for the long term.  We continue to believe this is the right path based on the benefits listed here.

## Employee Benefits
1. You have more flexibility in your daily life (for kids, parents, friends, groceries, sports, deliveries).

## Company Benefits
1. We're able to hire great people [no matter where they live](hiring.md).
