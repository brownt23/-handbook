# How We Connect
Since we don't have the same opportunity for serendipitous encounters with co-workers, our interactions must be more intentional.  We should all make an effort to get to know each other on a personal level; these policies help accomplish that goal.

## Annual Meatspace Meeting

 - Company retreat - at least once a year - airfare / hotels for all staff

## Promote Social Connection
 - Helping people socialize needs to be a top consideration - non-work topic slack channels, ad hoc video calls, etc
 - Prioritize work events where travel and physical interaction is involved (like company summits, meetups, events, conferences, etc.)

## Weekly all-hands
