# How We Connect
## Annual Meatspace Meeting
 - Company retreat - at least once a year - airfare / hotels for all staff

## Promote Social Connection
 - Helping people socialize needs to be a top consideration - non-work topic slack channels, ad hoc video calls, etc
 - Prioritize work events where travel and physical interaction is involved (like company summits, meetups, events, conferences, etc.)

## Weekly all-hands
