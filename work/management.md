# Management
 - Intentional management - No management by incidental encounter at the water cooler is possible - check ins have to be scheduled, etc - management is more intentional.
 - Measuring results, not hours, to understand employee performance
 - 360 feedback (or at least top down, bottom up)
 - Peer recognition is much more important - people need a sense of belonging that’s more explicit
 - Scheduled 1:1’s, skip 1:1’s
