# Management
Managing direct reports in an [all-remote](./index.md) environment comes with some unique challenges.

## Intentional Management
Our asynchronous workflows and distributed nature require intentional management; managers cannot rely on incidental encounters with reports at the water cooler.  Managers and reports must have regularly scheduled check-ins and clear paths for communication.

## One-on-ones
Managers should have regularly scheduled meetings with each direct report.  The meetings should be set at a frequency that both find most useful (at least monthly).  These meetings should be times for open feedback - in both directions - as well as anything that is on the manager or direct report's mind.

Skip one-on-ones, or meetings between a manager and a direct report's direct report (you and your boss' boss) are also encouraged.  

## Quarterly Feedback
Every quarter, each employee will be reviewed based on the extent to which they embody the [company values](../values/index.md).  Employees will also write a review of their boss, to be shared only with their boss' boss.  If you manage direct reports, then part of your review will include their feedback.

## Results Not Hours
Managers should be [focused on outcomes](../values/index.md#focus-on-outcomes-trophy), not hours worked.  Employees should be evaluated based on what they accomplish overall, not on how long it took to do it.

## Recognition
When your direct report, manager, or peer does something great, [make sure they get recognition](../values/index.md#recognize-others-clap).  People must know their work is valued; in a remote first environment, it can be harder to make sure people know this.  Extra, explicit effort is warranted.
