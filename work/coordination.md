## Async
https://basecamp.com/handbook/10-how-we-work#asynchronously
 - documenting all the things - and Slack is not documentation
 - Long term structure / storage for all documents / notes
 - Clear explanations for reasons behind decisions 
 - Conversations in google doc comments / github comments - not in Slack
 - Handbook first documentation
 - Goals / OKRs / KPIs need to be documented, measured, reviewed etc. in a routine/standard way 
 - Single sources of truth are even more important (metrics, agreement templates, meeting notes, etc) - which cannot be Slack
 - Async culture - working as though all of your co-workers are asleep - operate with an understanding that any team member could be offline at any time, for any reason
 - Retrospectives a la Agile work
 - Post mortems

## Meetings
 - Agendas before meetings, standup notes before meetings, etc
 - Notes for all meetings stored for perpetuity
 - No meetings to share information
 - Only meet to gather feedback from a specific proposal - brainwriting instead of brainstorming
 - Meetings must be scheduled, start on time, and end on time
 - There canâ€™t be bias toward one time zone
 - no start till all can attend

standup formats

weekly all hands
