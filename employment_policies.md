# Employment Policies and Practices

## Employment Offers
Offers of employment for all positions at the Company may be extended only by authorized managers and are contingent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

 * Verification of verification of identity, employment eligibility and criminal background (Parallel will not employ any individual unless they are legally approved to work in the United States, in compliance with immigration laws), 
 * Checking of references, prior employment and educational qualifications listed on the employment application and 
 * Signing of the relevant employment documentation, including this handbook, an inventions assignment agreement and other definitive documentation.

## Employment at Will
All employees of the Company, with the exception of those with written employment agreements that include provisions to the contrary, are employees at will and, as such, are free to resign at any time with or without reason. Parallel, likewise, retains the right to terminate an employee’s employment at any time with or without reason or notice.

## Independent Contractors
Managers who would like to hire an individual or a company as an independent contractor must first consult with the Talent & Culture Team ([people@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com)) to ensure that the position is appropriate for independent contractor status. Since IRS rules and tax and benefit implications regarding independent contractors are complicated, this step is necessary to ensure an individual may be properly classified as an independent contractor (rather than an employee). Before an individual or business can perform services for Parallel as an independent contractor, such individual or an authorized representative of the business must sign Parallel’s independent contractor agreement.

## Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy
It is, has been, and will continue to be Parallel's policy to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, age, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions), national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation marital status, personal appearance, family responsibilities, matriculation, political affiliation or any other factor protected by applicable law. Further, it is Parallel's policy to undertake affirmative action in compliance with all federal, state, and local requirements. Parallel wishes to take this opportunity to issue a formal reaffirmation of this policy and to assure each applicant, employee and party with whom we do business of our commitment to our equal opportunity and affirmative action objectives.

Our continued success depends heavily on the full and effective utilization of qualified persons. Parallel will continue to direct our employment practices toward ensuring equal opportunity for all. Parallel intends that all matters related to recruiting, hiring, training, compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, terminations, layoffs and recalls, as well as all Parallel-sponsored social and recreational programs and all treatment on the job be free of unlawful discriminatory practices.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
### All Unlawful Harassment Prohibited
Parallel is committed to maintaining a workplace free of unlawful harassment. Parallel strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful harassment against employees, interns, whether paid or unpaid, independent contractors, or any other covered persons because of race, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression (including status as a transgender individual), age, sexual orientation (including actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality), physical or mental disability (including gender dysphoria and similar gender-related conditions), citizenship, genetic information or predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, familial status, domestic violence victim status, military status, including past, current, or prospective service in the uniformed services, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, New York, or local law.

### Sexual Harassment
All Parallel employees, other workers, and their employees and representatives (including vendors, customers, subscribers,clients and visitors) are prohibited from harassing employees, interns, independent contractors, and other covered persons based on that individual’s sex, gender, sexual identity or transgender status and regardless of the harasser’s sex or gender.

Sexual harassment means any harassment based on someone’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, sexual identity or transgender status. Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender. Sexual harassment is considered a form of employee misconduct. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against individuals engaging in sexual harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue. 

Parallel prohibits retaliation against individuals who complain of sexual harassment or who testify or assist in any proceeding under the law. Any such retaliation is unlawful. No one will be subject to, and Parallel prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for good faith reporting of incidents of sexual harassment of any kind, pursuing any sexual harassment claim, or assisting or cooperating in related investigations or other proceedings.

Sexual harassment is unlawful when it subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or  privileges of employment. Harassment need not be severe or pervasive to be unlawful. It can be any harassing conduct that consists of more than petty slights or trivial inconveniences. Sexual harassment includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual’s sex or gender), as well as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature, when any of the following is true:

* Submission to or rejection of the advance, request, or conduct is
  * made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or
  * used as a basis for employment decisions.
* The advances, requests, or conduct have the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, even if the complaining individual is not the intended target of the harassment.

Parallel will not tolerate any form of sexual or other harassment, regardless of whether it is:

* Verbal (for example, epithets, derogatory statements, slurs, sexually-related comments, gestures, noises, or jokes, unwelcome sexual advances, or requests for sexual favors).
* Physical (for example, assault, groping, kissing, hugging, pinching, patting, or other inappropriate physical contact).
* Visual (for example, displaying sexually suggestive posters, cartoons, or drawings, sending inappropriate adult-themed gifts, or leering or making sexual gestures).
* Online (for example, derogatory statements or sexually suggestive postings in any social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).

The above list is illustrative only, and not exhaustive. No form of sexual harassment will be tolerated.

Sexual harassment and all other forms of harassment are prohibited both at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.

### Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure
Any employee, intern, independent contractor, or non-employee who has been subjected to behavior that may constitute sexual harassment, or witnesses behavior that may constitute sexual harassment, is encouraged to promptly speak to, write, email, or otherwise contact your direct supervisor or, if the conduct involves your direct supervisor, the next level above your direct supervisor or the Talent & Culture Team, ideally within ten (10) days of the offending conduct.

If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5) days after reporting any incident of what you perceive to be harassment, please immediately contact ([people@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com)). This group will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted. 

Complaints or reports of sexual harassment must be made in writing. To submit a written complaint of sexual harassment, employees must use the Complaint Form provided below. Employees who are reporting sexual harassment on behalf of other employees must use the Complaint Form and note that it is on another employee’s behalf. The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses.

Parallel is committed to enforcing this policy against all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on employees telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they must report it immediately. If employees do not report sexually harassing or other harassing conduct, Parallel may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action. Thus, each employee is obligated to report any violation in a timely manner. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal, harassment, intimidation, threats, or coercion.

### Investigation of Sexual Harassment
Parallel takes all complaints of harassment seriously. Parallel will promptly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all complaints of sexual and other harassment, whether the complaint was made verbally or in writing. Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an investigation of suspected sexual or other harassment. 

While the investigation process may vary from case to case, Parallel generally conducts an investigation as follows, with the Talent & Culture Team taking the lead on:

* Upon receipt of complaint, conducting an immediate review of the allegations, and taking any interim actions (e.g., instructing the respondent to refrain from communications with the complainant), as appropriate. 
  * If complaint is verbal, requiring the individual to complete the Complaint Form in writing. 
  * If he or she refuses, preparing a Complaint Form based on the verbal reporting.
* If documents, emails or phone records are relevant to the investigation, taking steps to obtain and preserve them.
* Requesting and reviewing all relevant documents, including all electronic communications.
* Interviewing all parties involved, including any relevant witnesses.
* Creating a written documentation of the investigation (such as a letter, memo or email), which contains the following:
  * A list of all documents reviewed, along with a detailed summary of relevant documents;
  * A list of names of those interviewed, along with a detailed summary of their statements;
  * A timeline of events;
  * A summary of prior relevant incidents, reported or unreported; and
  * The basis for the decision and final resolution of the complaint, together with any corrective action(s).
* Keeping the written documentation and associated documents in a secure and confidential location.
* Promptly notifying the individual who reported and the individual(s) about whom the complaint was made of the final determination and implement any corrective actions identified in the written document.
* Informing the individual who reported of the right to file a complaint or charge externally, as detailed below.

All persons involved, including complainants, witnesses, and alleged harassers, will be accorded due process to protect their rights to a fair and impartial investigation. The investigation will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible, consistent with conducting a thorough and fair investigation. 

Parallel will take prompt corrective action as appropriate to eliminate sexual and other harassment, including disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.

### Alternative Reporting and Remedies
Parallel requires employees to report incidents of sexual harassment internally. However, employees who believe they have been subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace also may seek relief by:

* Filing a complaint alleging violation of the NYSHRL either with the Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR) or in New York State Supreme Court. NYSDHR’s main office contact information is: NYS Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458. You may call (718) 741-8400 or visit: [www.dhr.ny.gov](http://www.dhr.ny.gov). You can also contact NYSDHR at (888) 392-3644 or visit [dhr.ny.gov/complaint](http://dhr.ny.gov/complaint) for more information about filing a complaint. 
* Filing a “Charge of Discrimination” with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). Employees can contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-6820), visiting their website at [www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov), or by email at [info@eeoc.gov](mailto:info@eeoc.gov).

Local jurisdictions may have additional protections against sexual harassment and discrimination. Employees can contact the county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists.

For example, employees who work in New York City may file complaints of sexual harassment with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. Contact their main office at Law Enforcement Bureau of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, 40 Rector Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York; call 311 or (212) 306-7450; or visit [www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml).

If the harassment involves criminal activity, employees should contact the local police department.

### Other Types of Harassment
Parallel’s anti-harassment policy applies equally to harassment based on an employee’s race, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, physical or mental disability, citizenship, genetic information or predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, familial status, domestic violence victim status, actual or perceived sexual orientation, military status, including past, present, or prospective service in the uniformed services or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. 

Such harassment often takes a similar form to sexual harassment and includes harassment that is:

* Verbal (for example, epithets, derogatory statements, slurs, derogatory comments, or jokes).
* Physical (for example, assault or other inappropriate physical contact).
* Visual (for example, displaying derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings, or making derogatory gestures).
* Online (for example, derogatory statements or suggestive postings in any social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).

This list is illustrative only, and not exhaustive. No form of harassment will be tolerated.

Harassment is prohibited both at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.

### Harassment Complaint Procedure
If you are subjected to any conduct that you believe violates this policy or witness any such conduct, you must promptly speak to, write, email, or otherwise contact your direct supervisor or, if the conduct involves your direct supervisor, the next level above your direct supervisor or the Human Resources Department, ideally within ten (10) days of the offending conduct. If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5) days after reporting any incident of what you perceive to be harassment, please immediately contact the Talent & Culture Team ([people@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com)). This team will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted. 

Complaints or reports of any form of harassment must be made in writing. To submit a written complaint of harassment, employees must use the Complaint Form provided below. Employees who are reporting harassment on behalf of other employees must use the Complaint Form and note that it is on another employee’s behalf. 

The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. Parallel will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of perceived harassment and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.

Additionally, any manager or supervisor who observes harassing conduct must report the conduct to the Talent & Culture Team ([people@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com)) so that an investigation can be made and corrective action taken, if appropriate. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they must report it immediately. If employees do not report harassing conduct, Parallel may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action. Thus, each employee is obligated to report any violation in a timely manner. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal, harassment, intimidation, threats, or coercion.

### No Retaliation
Retaliation against employees, interns, independent contractors, or any other covered individual who in good faith file complaints, or truthfully participate in or assist with an investigation or proceeding involving sexual or other harassment, is unlawful. Parallel prohibits retaliation against individuals who complain of sexual or other harassment or who testify or assist in any proceeding under the law. Any such retaliation is unlawful. No one will be subject to, and Parallel prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for good faith reporting of incidents of sexual harassment or harassment of any kind, pursuing any sexual or other harassment claim, or assisting another individual to report sexual harassment or other harassment, or cooperating in related investigations or other proceedings.

### Responsibilities of Supervisors and Managers
All supervisors and managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual harassment or other harassment, observe what may be sexually harassing behavior or other harassing behavior, or for any reason suspect that sexual harassment or other harassment is occurring, are required to report such suspected sexual harassment or other harassment to the Talent & Culture Team. 

In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct or other harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual or other harassment, or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual or other harassment to continue. 

Supervisors and managers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation.

### Violations of This Policy
Any employee, regardless of position or title, whom Parallel determines has subjected an individual to harassment or retaliation in violation of this policy, or has knowingly allowed such behavior to continue, will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

### Administration of This Policy
The Talent & Culture team is responsible for the administration of this policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy or questions about harassment that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the Human Resources Department.

### Conduct Not Prohibited by this Policy
This policy is not intended to restrict communications or actions protected or required by state or federal law.

### Complaint Form

Instructions: Parallel is committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Parallel’s Anti-Harassment Policy outlines Parallel’s prohibitions against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. This policy can be found in in the Parallel Employee Handbook. 

This policy provides mandatory procedures with several options for employees to report prohibited conduct. One option for reporting discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is to complete this form and provide it to the Talent & Culture Team. You are not required to use this particular form to file a complaint. However, you should read and be aware of Parallel’s mandatory reporting procedures, whether you choose to use this form or not. 

Any employee can report discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, whether as a victim or a witness. Regardless of your experience with the discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, it is important to be as specific as possible in your complaint so that Parallel can fully investigate the conduct and take prompt corrective action, as necessary. Include all known information about the complaint, including the identity of any witnesses with knowledge of the allegations or offenses and any other known evidence related to the complaint. You are not limited to the space provided. Parallel encourages you to attach any additional materials that may assist us in investigating the claim. Although not encouraged because it limits our ability to verify the facts alleged in your complaint, you may submit this complaint anonymously.

To investigate the complaint, Parallel will need to interview you, those subject to the alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation (if not yourself), the alleged offender(s), and any known witnesses. However, Parallel will notify all individuals involved that the investigation is confidential to the extent permitted by law and make clear that unauthorized disclosures could result in disciplinary action.

## Anti-Corruption Policy

### 1. Introduction.

**Combating Corruption**. Parallel Markets Inc. ("***Parallel***" or the "***Company***") operates in a wide range of legal and business environments, many of which pose challenges to our ability to conduct our business operations with integrity. As a company, we strive to conduct ourselves according to the highest standards of ethical conduct. Throughout its operations, the Company seeks to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in the actions of its directors, officers, employees, and agents.

Accordingly, this Anti-Corruption Policy (the “***Anti-Corruption Policy***”) reiterates our commitment to integrity, and explains the specific requirements and prohibitions applicable to our operations under anti-corruption laws, including, but not limited to, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“***FCPA***”). This Anti-Corruption Policy contains information intended to reduce the risk of corruption and bribery from occurring in the Company's activities. The Company strictly prohibits all forms of corruption and bribery and will take all necessary steps to ensure that corruption and bribery do not occur in its business activities.

Under the FCPA, it is illegal for US persons, including US companies or any companies traded on US exchanges, and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and agents, to bribe non-US government officials. The concept of prohibiting bribery is simple. However, understanding the full scope of the FCPA is essential as this law directly affects everyday business interactions between the Company and non-US governments and government-owned or government-controlled entities.
Violations of the FCPA can also result in violations of other US laws, including anti-money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy laws. The penalties for violating the FCPA are severe. In addition to being subject to the Company's disciplinary policies (including termination), individuals who violate the FCPA may also be subject to imprisonment and fines.
Aside from the FCPA, the Company may also be subject to other non-US anti-corruption laws, in addition to the local laws of the countries in which the Company conducts business. This Anti-Corruption Policy generally sets forth the expectations and requirements for compliance with those laws.

**Applicability**. This Anti-Corruption Policy is applicable to all of the Company's operations worldwide. This Anti-Corruption Policy applies to all of the Company's directors, officers, and employees. This Anti-Corruption Policy also applies to the Company's agents, consultants, joint venture partners, and any other third-party representatives that, on behalf of the Company, have conducted business outside of the US or interacted with non-US government officials or are likely to conduct business outside of the US or interact with non-US government officials.

### 2.	Prohibited Payments.  

Company employees and agents are prohibited from directly or indirectly making, promising, authorizing, or offering anything of value to a non-US government official on behalf of the Company to secure an improper advantage, obtain or retain business, or direct business to any other person or entity. This prohibition includes payments to third-parties where the Company employee or agent knows, or has reason to know, that the third-party will use any part of the payment for bribes.

**(a) Cash and Non-Cash Payments: “Anything of Value.”** Payments that violate the FCPA may arise in a variety of settings and include a broad range of payments beyond the obvious cash bribe or kickback. The FCPA prohibits giving “anything of value” for an improper purpose. This term is very broad and can include, for example:

* Gifts.
* Travel, meals, lodging, entertainment, or gift cards.
* Loans or non-arm's length transactions.
* Charitable or political donations.
* Business, employment, or investment opportunities.

**(b)	Non-US Government Official.** The FCPA broadly defines the term non-US government official to include:

* Officers or employees of a non-US government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.
* Officers or employees of a company or business owned in whole or in part by a non-US government (a state owned or controlled enterprises).
* Officers or employees of a public international organization (such as the United Nations, World Bank, or the European Union).
* Non-US political parties or officials thereof.
* Candidates for non-US political office.

This term also includes anyone acting on behalf of any of the above.

On occasion, a non-US government official may attempt to solicit or extort improper payments or anything of value from Company employees or agents. Such employees or agents must inform the non-US government official that the Company does not engage in such conduct and immediately contact our Legal Dapartment ([legal@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:legal@parallelmarkets.com)).

**(c)	Commercial Bribery.** Bribery involving commercial (non-governmental parties) is also prohibited under this Anti-Corruption Policy. To this end, Company employees and agents shall not offer, promise, authorize the payment of, or pay or provide anything of value to any employee, agent, or representative of another company to induce or reward the improper performance of any function or any business-related activity. Company employees and agents also shall not request, agree to receive, or accept anything of value from any employee, agent, or representative of another company or entity as an inducement or reward for the improper performance of any function or business-related activity.

### 3.	Permitted Payments.

The FCPA does not prohibit all payments to non-US government officials. In general, the FCPA permits three categories of payments:

**(a)	Facilitating Payments.** The FCPA includes an exception for nominal payments made to low-level government officials to ensure or speed the proper performance of a government official's routine, non-discretionary duties or actions, such as:

* Clearing customs.
* Processing governmental papers such as visas, permits, or licenses.
* Providing police protection.
* Providing mail, telephone, or utility services.

**(b)	Promotional Hospitality and Marketing Expenses or Pursuant to a Contract.** The Company may pay for the reasonable cost of a non-US government official's meals, lodging, or travel if, and only if, the expenses are bona fide, reasonable, and directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of Company products or services, or the execution of a contract with a non-US government or agency.

**(c)	Promotional Gifts.** Promotional gifts of nominal value may be given to a non-US government official as a courtesy in recognition of services rendered or to promote goodwill. These gifts must be nominal in value and should generally bear the trademark of the Company or one of its products.

### 4.	Political and Charitable Contributions.  

Contributions to candidates for non-US political office are prohibited unless the Compliance Officer pre-approves them in writing. Charitable contributions to non-US charities must also be pre-approved in writing by the Compliance Officer.

### 5.	Record Keeping.  

It is the Company's Anti-Corruption Policy to implement and maintain internal accounting controls based upon sound accounting principles. All accounting entries in the Company's books and records must be timely and accurately recorded and include reasonable detail to fairly reflect transactions. These accounting entries and the supporting documentation must be periodically reviewed to identify and correct discrepancies, errors, and omissions.

**(a)	Authorization for Transactions.** All transactions involving the provision of anything of value to a non-US government official must occur only with appropriate Company authorization.

**(b)	Recording Transactions.** All transactions involving the provision of anything of value to a non-US government official must be recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

**(c)	Tracking Transactions.** All transactions involving the provision of anything of value to a non-US government official must be tracked in a separate log or record, with supporting documentation identifying: 

* The name and position of the employee requesting and authorizing the transaction.
* The name and position of the non-US government official involved in the transaction.
* A description, including the value, of the payment or provision of anything of value, and where applicable, a description of the Company's products or services being promoted or the relevant contractual provision if the payment was made pursuant to a contract.

### 6.	Cash Payments.  

Cash payments of any kind to a third-party, other than documented petty cash disbursements or other valid and approved payments, are prohibited. Company checks shall not be written to “cash,” “bearer,” or anyone other than the party entitled to payment except to replenish properly used petty cash funds.

### 7.	Representatives.  

All third-party Company representatives must fully comply with the FCPA and all other applicable laws.

### 8.	Compliance.  

Company employees and agents must be familiar with and perform their duties according to the requirements set out in this Anti-Corruption Policy. Company employees or agents who violate this Anti-Corruption Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Third-party representatives who violate this Anti-Corruption Policy may be subject to termination of all commercial relationships with the Company.

To ensure that all Company employees and agents are thoroughly familiar with the provisions of this Anti-Corruption Policy, the FCPA, and any other applicable anti-corruption laws, the Company shall provide anti-corruption training and resources to those Company employees and agents, as appropriate.

Any Company employee or agent who suspects that this Anti-Corruption Policy may have been violated must immediately notify the Company as specified in the section entitled “Reporting Anti-Corruption Policy Violations” below. Any Company employee who, in good faith, reports suspected legal, ethical, or Anti-Corruption Policy violations will not suffer any adverse consequence for doing so. When in doubt about the appropriateness of any conduct, the Company requires that you seek additional guidance before taking any action that may subject the Company to potential FCPA liability.

### 9.	Duty to Cooperate.  

The Company may at times undertake a more detailed review of certain transactions. As part of these reviews, the Company requires all employees, agents, and third-party representatives to cooperate with the Company, outside legal counsel, outside auditors, or other similar parties. The Company views failure to cooperate in an internal review as a breach of your obligations to the Company, and will deal with this failure severely in accordance with any local laws or regulations.

### 10.	Questions About the Anti-Corruption Policy.  
If you have any questions relating to this Anti-Corruption Policy, please contact the Legal Department ([legal@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:legal@parallelmarkets.com)).

### 11.	Reporting Anti-Corruption Policy Violations.  

To report potential violations of this Anti-Corruption Policy, immediately notify the Legal Department ([legal@parallelmarkets.com](mailto:legal@parallelmarkets.com)).

### 12.	Acknowledgment.  

I have received and read a copy of the Parallel Markets Inc. Anti-Corruption Policy and understand its contents. I understand that Parallel Markets Inc. expressly reserves the right to change, modify, or delete its provisions without notice.

Further, I understand that my employment is voluntarily entered into, that I am free to resign at any time and that Parallel Markets Inc. may terminate the employment relationship whenever it so determines with or without notice or cause. I am employed at will, and this Anti-Corruption Policy does not modify my at will employment status.

## Workplace Violence
Parallel is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. As such, we have adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment or other threats of or actual violence that may occur onsite or offsite during work-related activities.

All employees, customers, vendors and business associates should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, “horseplay” or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Conduct that threatens, intimidates or coerces another employee, customer, vendor or business associate will not be tolerated. Parallel resources may not be used to threaten, stalk or harass anyone at or outside the workplace.

Indirect or direct threats of violence, incidents of actual violence and suspicious individuals or activities should be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor, security personnel, human resources, or any member of senior management.  When reporting a threat or incident of violence, the employee should be as specific and detailed as possible. Employees should not place themselves in peril, nor should they attempt to intercede during an incident.

Employees should promptly inform the HR department of any protective or restraining order that they have obtained that lists the workplace as a protected area. Employees are encouraged to report safety concerns with regard to intimate partner violence. We are committed to supporting victims of intimate partner violence by providing referrals to the company’s employee assistance program and community resources.

### Investigations and Enforcement
Parallel will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of physical or verbal altercations, threats of violence, or other conduct by employees that threaten the health or safety of other employees or the public. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as possible. We will not retaliate against employees making good- faith reports of violence, threats or suspicious individuals or activities. To maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Parallel Markets may suspend employees suspected of workplace violence or threats of violence, either with or without pay, pending investigation.

Anyone found to be responsible for threats of or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

## Personal Relationships at Work
Managers and employees with supervisory responsibility may not have a romantic, dating or sexual relationship with any employee to whom they assign work or for whom they evaluate or influence employment or compensation decisions, without promptly advising the Human Resources Department of their relationship, so that appropriate assurances/arrangements can be made to assure any potential conflict of interest and/or adverse effect on the workplace is minimized. This may include a voluntary change in the reporting relationship if reasonably practicable. In addition, the Company reserves the right to alter the reporting relationship of the parties involved, which may involve reassignment of either or both parties.
